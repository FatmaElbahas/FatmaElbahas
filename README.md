## About Me

I am a Full Stack .NET Developer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development. I specialize in creating scalable, efficient, and user-friendly applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for the front end, and C#, .NET Framework, ASP.NET, and SQL Server for the back end.

I have developed projects including a Jewelry E-commerce Platform, a Restaurant Website, and a Gym Management Desktop Application, focusing on seamless user experiences and robust system performance. My problem-solving skills, combined with effective communication and teamwork, allow me to tackle complex challenges and deliver high-quality results.

I am committed to continuous learning and growth, staying updated with the latest technologies to build impactful solutions that support business success. I am always eager to explore new opportunities and contribute to innovative projects in software development.
