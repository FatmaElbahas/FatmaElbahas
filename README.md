## About Me

I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented Full Stack .NET Developer with a strong foundation in both front-end and
back-end development. With a passion for technology and problem-solving, I excel in designing and implementing scalable,
efficient, and user-friendly applications. My expertise includes front-end development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
React to create responsive and interactive user interfaces, as well as back-end development with C#, .NET Framework,
ASP.NET, and SQL Server to build robust and secure systems.

I have successfully developed various projects, including a Jewelry E-commerce Platform that integrates both front-end
and back-end technologies to provide a seamless shopping experience. I also built a Restaurant Website focusing on
enhancing user experience through modern design techniques, and a Gym Management Desktop Application that offers users
an efficient platform to track and manage their fitness goals.

I am known for my strong problem-solving skills, which enable me to tackle complex challenges and deliver high-quality
results. Additionally, I possess excellent communication and teamwork abilities, which allow me to collaborate
effectively with diverse teams. I am dedicated to continuous learning and professional growth, ensuring that I stay
updated with the latest technologies and trends in the field of software development.

My goal is to contribute to innovative projects as a Full Stack .NET Developer, leveraging my technical skills to
deliver impactful solutions and support organizational success. I am always open to exploring new opportunities that
allow me to expand my expertise and make a meaningful contribution to the tech industry.
